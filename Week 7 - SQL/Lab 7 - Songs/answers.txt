1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you
   characterize their audio aura?

    +-------------+--------------+-------------------+
    | AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
    +-------------+--------------+-------------------+
    | 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
    +-------------+--------------+-------------------+

    The individual's Audio Aura appears to be balanced across the three
    attributes, although there is a slightly stronger inclination towards
    energy and danceability.

2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very
   representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura
   would you propose?

   A person's musical preference can be very complex. Using just energy, valence,
   and danceability doesn't account for other qualities of music that a person
   may value. I would also consider the frequency of different music genres that
   the person listens to throughout the year.
