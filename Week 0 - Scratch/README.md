CS50x Week 0 Scratch Problem Set 0

My Scratch project is called 'Dodge the Laser!' The goal is to dodge as many laser beams as you can that are shooting out from the enemy robot. Scores are tracked and difficulty will increase over time with the laser beams shooting out faster. The player can move left, right, jump by pressing spacebar, or even duck by pressing the down arrow key. If player touches the laser, it's game over!
