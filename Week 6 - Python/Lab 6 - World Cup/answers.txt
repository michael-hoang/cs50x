Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

    When the number of simulations increased from 10 to 1,000,000:
    Denmark went from 20% chance of winning to 3.2%
    Belgium went from 10% chance of winning to 21.1%

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

    Predictions are good enough after 1,000 simulations because the 5 teams with
    the highest win rate remain in the top 5 even after 1,000,000 simulations, and
    their win rates only deviate by plus or minus 1%.
